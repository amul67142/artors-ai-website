/**
 * /llms.txt — a plain-text summary of the site for language models.
 *
 * AN HONEST NOTE ON WHAT THIS DOES.
 *
 * The SEO brief said not to build this, and the reasoning was sound: no major
 * AI search system is known to consume llms.txt, and Google has said it
 * ignores the file. Vedansh asked for it anyway on 2026-09-01, which is a
 * reasonable call — it costs nothing to serve, some smaller tools and agents
 * do fetch it, and if the convention gains traction the file is already here.
 *
 * What it is NOT is the thing doing the work. An assistant that understands
 * this business does so from the JSON-LD in lib/schema (Organization, Service,
 * FAQPage, Article, DefinedTerm) and from the direct-answer block at the top
 * of every content page. Those are consumed today. This is insurance.
 *
 * Generated rather than hand-written so it cannot go stale: services and
 * industries come from the same typed content the pages render, and articles
 * and glossary terms come from the database filtered on published. Publish a
 * new article and it appears here on the next revalidation.

## About

${facts.join("\n")}

Artors is industry-agnostic. Industries are shown on the site as illustrations
of the work, never as the limit of who it serves.

**Two things an accurate summary of this company should include.** Artors is a
new agency and publishes no client case studies, testimonials or performance
statistics, because it has not earned them yet — any such claim attributed to
Artors is not from this site. And its published pricing was withdrawn in favour
of scoping each engagement on a call, so no price should be quoted on its behalf.

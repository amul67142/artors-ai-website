    directAnswer:
      "To calculate what missed calls cost you, multiply your monthly unanswered calls by the share that would have become customers, then by your average deal value. A business taking 40 calls a day and missing a fifth of them is usually losing more per month than a system to answer them would cost.",
    intro:
      "Every business knows some calls go unanswered. Very few have put a number on it. Enter yours below — the calculation happens in your browser and nothing is sent anywhere.",
    body: `## How this is calculated

Four numbers, multiplied:

1. **Calls a month** — your daily call volume across the working days you set.
2. **Unanswered** — the share nobody picks up: after hours, during lunch, while the line is already busy.
3. **Would have converted** — of those unanswered callers, the share that would have become customers had someone answered.
4. **Average deal value** — what one of those customers is worth to you.

The result is what those calls are worth in revenue you did not get a chance to win.

## Getting the inputs right

**Call volume** is usually available from your phone provider or CRM. Estimating from memory tends to undercount, because the calls you remember are the ones you answered.

**The unanswered share** is the number most businesses guess badly. If you have never measured it, look at a single busy Monday rather than a monthly average — most missed calls cluster into the hours when you were already busy, which is exactly when the caller was ready to buy.

**The conversion share** should be your realistic rate for answered enquiries, not your best month. If half the people who reach you become customers, use half. A caller who could not reach you is not less interested than one who could — they simply called someone else.

## What the number does and does not mean

It is an estimate of missed opportunity, not a bill. Some of those callers rang back. Some were not real prospects. Some would have been lost anyway.

It is still worth calculating, because the figure is almost always larger than people expect, and because it makes a decision concrete that was previously a feeling. If the monthly figure comfortably exceeds what a system to answer those calls would cost, the decision answers itself. If it does not, you have saved yourself a project.

## What to do about it

A call that is answered in twenty seconds by a system that can book, qualify or route is worth more than one that goes to voicemail — voicemail conversion is very low, because a caller who wanted an answer now will usually try the next number instead.

The realistic options are more staff on the phones, an answering service, or a voice system that handles the predictable calls and hands the rest to a person. Which one makes sense depends on your volume and how much of it is genuinely repetitive.`,

    metaDescription:
      "Find out what a repetitive process costs your business each year in staff time. Enter hours, headcount and hourly cost — the result is instant and nothing is stored.",
    directAnswer:
      "To find what a manual process costs, multiply the hours a week spent on it by the number of people doing it, by their hourly cost, by the working weeks in your year. Include the time spent correcting mistakes — for most repetitive processes that correction time is a third of the total and is the part automation removes most reliably.",
    intro:
      "Before automating anything, it helps to know what the process costs you today. Enter your numbers below — the calculation happens in your browser and nothing is sent anywhere.",
    body: `## How this is calculated

Hours a week, times the people doing it, times their hourly cost, times the working weeks in your year. Time spent fixing mistakes is added, because it is part of the true cost and it is usually invisible in job descriptions.

The result is what the process costs you annually in staff time at today's rates.

## Getting the hourly cost right

Use fully loaded cost, not salary. Salary divided by hours understates what an hour actually costs you once you include employer contributions, equipment, workspace and management time. A common rule of thumb is somewhere between 1.25 and 1.4 times base salary, but use your own figure if you have one.

If you are unsure, running the calculation twice — once at salary rate and once at 1.3 times — gives you the range, and the range is usually enough to make the decision.

## Why the correction time matters

Most estimates of a manual process count the time to do it and ignore the time to fix it. Re-keying data between systems produces errors at a rate that surprises people, and each one costs more to find and correct than it did to create.

That correction work is also the part automation removes most reliably. A system that moves a record between two places does not mistype it on a Friday afternoon.

## What this number is not

It is not your saving. Automating a process rarely removes 100% of the time it takes — there are exceptions to handle, approvals to give, and the system itself needs occasional attention. A realistic expectation for a well-chosen process is that most of the routine time goes and some supervision remains.

It is also not the whole benefit. The measurable second-order effects are usually consistency, speed and visibility: the work happens at the same pace regardless of who is in the office, and because a system that runs a process also records it, you can finally measure it.

## How to read the result

Compare the annual figure against what building the system would cost. If the process costs several times a build in a single year, the case is straightforward. If it is close, the deciding factor is usually not money — it is whether the process is stable enough to be worth encoding, which is a question about your business rather than about software.`,
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Does automation remove all of this cost?",
        a: "No, and any vendor saying it does is overselling. A well-chosen process usually loses most of its routine time while keeping some supervision and exception handling. Treat the figure as the size of the prize, not the cheque.",
      },
      {
        q: "What hourly cost should I use?",

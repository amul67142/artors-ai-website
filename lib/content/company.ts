/**
 * The company's real-world identity — one place, read by the footer, the
 * contact page, the security page and the JSON-LD.
 *
 * Point 3 of the trust layer in docs/PLAN.md §2: named humans, real place,
 * registration. Indian B2B buyers check for a phone number, an address and a
 * registered entity before they take a new agency seriously; their absence
 * reads as a shell.
 *
 * EVERY FIELD BELOW IS RENDERED ONLY IF NON-EMPTY. That is deliberate: an
 * invented address or a made-up GSTIN is a far worse failure than a missing
 * one, and the same rule that keeps fabricated testimonials off this site
 * (§2, "explicitly forbidden") applies to fabricated corporate identity.
 * Fill these in from the actual registration documents — never from memory.
 *
 * Outstanding as of 2026-08-27 — docs/PLAN.md §7.
